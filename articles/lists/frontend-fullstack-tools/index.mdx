Here is a list of tools I came across during my frontend journey.

## Tool Manager

<Olink bold link="https://volta.sh/">
  Volta
</Olink> is a JavaScript tool manager. You are working on two projects. One requires
Node version 16 and other requires version 14. It is difficult to switch between
these version even with `nvm`. Install volta in your laptop. Then have the volta
configuration in your project. Rest happens automatically.

<Olink bold link="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">
  NVM
</Olink> stands of Node Version Manager. It helps to switch between different Node.js
versions in our laptop. It helps to prevent reinstallation of Node.js as per project
requirements.

<Olink bold link="https://typicode.github.io/husky/">
  Husky
</Olink> can run some tasks before we make a commit to Git. Suppose, we want to check
for ESLint errors in the files we worked, before committing it. Husky can help here.

## Cloud

<Olink bold link="https://aws.amazon.com/">
  AWS
</Olink> or Amazon Web Services is a cloud provider. We can setup servers or use
services provided by Amazon infrastructure. Its suits applications of all scales.

## Code Quality

<Olink bold link="https://eslint.org/">
  ESLint
</Olink> analyze and find problems in JS code. It is available in most of the text
editors and can also be used as part of CI/CD.
<Divider />
<Olink bold link="https://prettier.io/">
  Prettier
</Olink> is a code formatter. It is a stable formatter used in many big
projects. Having a `.prettierrc` file in your project ensures uniform code
formatting across all developers. Otherwise there are chances that a file change
in Git shows only formatting changes.

## Bundle the Code

<Olink bold link="https://webpack.js.org/">
  Webpack
</Olink> is a widely used code bundler. It crunches JS, JSX, SASS or whatever and
creates a bundle out of it.
<Divider />

  Metro
</Olink> is a JavaScript bundler for React Native applications developed by
Meta(previously Facebook)

## Testing

<Olink bold link="https://jestjs.io/">
  Jest
</Olink> is a JavaScript testing framework. Very popular and supports snapshot testing
in React.

  Live Server
</Olink> is a Visual Studio Code extension that can run a html file from a development
server. We can right click on a file directly from VS Code and open it using this
live server.

## Type Check

<Olink bold link="https://flow.org/">
  Flow
</Olink> is a static type checker for JavaScript. Stripe used it in their Dashboard.
Later they <Olink link="https://stripe.com/blog/migrating-to-typescript">
  moved to TypeScript
</Olink>
.

<Divider />
<Olink bold link="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">
  TypeScript
</Olink> does static type checking in JavaScript. It is currently maintained by
Microsoft and well supported by Visual Studio Code.
<Divider />
<Olink bold link="https://github.com/Airtable/typescript-migration-codemod">
  Airtable Codemod
</Olink> is an open source code from Airtable to convert codebase from Flow to TypeScript.
All edge cases are not covered, but a good starting point if you are considering
to change Flow to TypeScript in one go.
